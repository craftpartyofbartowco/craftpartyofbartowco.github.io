        <div class = "index-container">
            
            <div class = "about">
                
                <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Allison and Iâ€™m a cofounder of Craft Party along with Kimberly Lee. I started this Directory and I want to thank all of y'all in advance for using it to the max! We hope you enjoy!! 
                    <br><br>Craft Party is a community in Bartow County, Georgia where crafters share what they make and support each other's crafting journeys. Weâ€™re basically organizing a social and creative hub for local crafters.
                    
                    Kimberly and I are both avid crafters. We wanted to join a community where we could share our crafting journeys with other people. But we noticed there wasnâ€™t a go-to local craft group. So we started the Craft Party group last fall to start that community ourselves!
            
                    </p>

                    <p>We want you to use the directory as a creative discovery tool. A little like Human Pinterest ðŸ¤ªWe want you to make new connections, new friends, and come up with all kinds of new creative projects, collaborations, team-ups, and study groups. We are here to facilitate you discovering these creative possibilities as well as to facilitate and create a space for them to happen.
                    <br><br>As a data loving creative, I've dreamed of ways we can leverage the people and resources around us to help us enrich our quality of life and work and move forward in step together, towards whatever goal or dream that may be. This directory is a little slice of that dream, so thank you in advance for those of you who will participate.</p>
